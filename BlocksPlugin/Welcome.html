# Welcome!

This project will build a new Blocks plugin. It should build as is without requiring any changes. The result will be a `.plugin` file that will add a new menu and menu item when installed in a Blocks based application. To try this out:

1. Quit the application that you want to install the plugin in.
2. Copy the plugin into the applications plugins folder ~/Library/Application Support/APPLICATION_NAME/Plugins
3. Restart the application that you are installing into.

If things don't work as expected check in Console.app, Blocks tries to print lots of logging info when something doesn't work correctly.

Now that you have a working plugin, it is time to turn it into YOUR working plugin. To do that:

1. Browse the [AssembledDocumentation.html](AssembledDocumentation.html) file. This file contains api/extension point documentation for all plugins that existed at the time that this project was generated.
2. Browse the AssembledHeaders folder that's also part of this projectto see any public headers declared by the different plugins.
3. Choose the plugins and extension points that you're plugin will use and extend. Feel free to delete the other headers that you won't be using.
4. Add a `requirement` element to your `Plugin.xml` file for each plugin that you want to use.
5. Add an `extension` elemeent to your `Plugin.xml` file for each extension that you want to create.
